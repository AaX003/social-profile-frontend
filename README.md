## Social Links Profile - Orange-Grey Edition 🧡🖤

This project was my personalized touch of the Frontend Mentor "Social Links Profile" challenge. I maintained the default card layout, but customized the design using my own color palette! I experimented with different styles and it was a very hard decision settling with just one 😅.

## ✨ Demo Preview

## 🏆 The Challenge

- View the project centered on the page
